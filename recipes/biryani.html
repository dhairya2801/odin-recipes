    <p>This is a traditional Indian rice-based dish enjoyed all across the country, though it has its roots in Mughal cuisine. 
        Biryani is highly aromatic, rich in flavors, and often prepared for special occasions or weekend dinners. 
        It is usually paired with Lassi as the side. Lassi is a refreshing yogurt-based drink, perfectly balancing the spices of 
        the Biryani with its cool sweetness and creamy thickness. I can confirm that after this royal combination, you are sure 
        to feel completely satisfied and at peace. Check the recipe below to make it close to perfection!
