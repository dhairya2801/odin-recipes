    <p>This is a traditional <strong>vegetarian</strong> Indian dish mainly found in North regions of the country. This 
        dish is highly rich in nutrients and mostly prepared for dinner. It is mainly served with Lassi as the side. Lassi
        is a drink which is made from curd and its taste is the perfect quantity of sweetness and thickness. I can confirm
        that after this heavenly meal, you are sure to have one of the <em>best sleeps of your life</em>. Check
        the recipe below to make it close to perfection!
